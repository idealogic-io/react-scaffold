  "ProjectDescription": {
    "article1": "This branch was forked from the basic web3 scaffold with the aim of creating a template for even faster creation and deployment of uncomplicated DApp applications. The project utilizes a set of libraries including Rainbow-kit, wagmi, and view, which \"out-of-the-box\" fully take over the management and handling of all issues related to connecting the application to the web3 network, reading and writing data in the web3 network, multicalls, and many other functions.",
    "article2": "One downside of this approach is that it's quite challenging to customize the blockchain interaction logic if the project requires any non-standard solutions in this regard, as all the \"under-the-hood\" logic is handled by the libraries. Therefore, for creating large and complex DApps that require equally complex and non-standard solutions, using this scaffold is not recommended due to customization difficulties.",
    "article3": "This scaffold is perfectly suited for small DApps with straightforward logic and allows for significantly reducing the time-to-market and the development time."
